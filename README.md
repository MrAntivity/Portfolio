# Aiden Yue · Portfolio

This repository contains a single-page personal website designed to be hosted with GitHub Pages. All copy blocks are pre-structured so you can quickly port the content from your LinkedIn profile into each section.

## Getting started

1. Replace the placeholder text in `index.html` with the real information from your LinkedIn profile—summary, experience, projects, skills, and contact details.
2. Update the contact links with the best ways for people to reach you.
3. Optionally swap the placeholder portrait in `assets/portrait.svg` with a photo of your own.
4. Commit your changes and push to the `main` branch. Then enable GitHub Pages for the repository.

## Development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser to preview the site, or use a lightweight development server such as `python -m http.server` for live reloading while editing.

The page uses Inter and Material Symbols via Google Fonts, so an active internet connection is required to load those assets at runtime.
